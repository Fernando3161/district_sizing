## Introduction

District Sizing is a powerful tool developed to find the optimal sizing of devices for energy supply within an energy system. The project utilizes Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) and oemof, a Python-based library for energy system modeling. The tool provides sizing recommendations for various technologies, including Photovoltaics (PV), Wind, Energy Storage, and Power-to-Heat (P2H) technologies, tailored specifically for residential districts.

Whether you are planning to design a new energy system for a residential area or seeking to optimize an existing one, District Sizing offers a user-friendly interface to analyze and determine the best combination of devices to ensure an efficient and sustainable energy supply.

## Features

- Perform Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) to find the optimal device sizes for energy supply.
- Support for Photovoltaics (PV) technology to harness solar energy.
- Integration of Wind technology for utilizing wind power.
- Incorporate Energy Storage solutions to balance energy demand and supply.
- Utilize Power-to-Heat (P2H) technologies to convert excess electricity into heat.
- Interactive and intuitive interface for easy configuration and analysis.
